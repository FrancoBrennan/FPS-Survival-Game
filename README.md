The player's life will automatically regenerate if not attacked for 10 seconds, allowing for a brief strategic life recovery.

### Player User Interface
The Player User Interface includes:
- Accumulated money counter.
- Round number.
- Buttons for shooting, reloading, aiming, jumping, and moving.
- An icon of the weapon the player is using along with its bullets in the magazine and remaining bullets.
- A crosshair in the center of the screen.
- An FPS (Frames per Second) counter.

### Weapons and Equipment
At the start of the game, the player will have a revolver. The only way to obtain new weapons is by purchasing the "Mystery Box," which will provide a random weapon in exchange for money. Regarding ammunition, the ways to reload the complete ammunition are by buying the "Mystery Box" and exchanging the weapon without ammunition. There are 4 types of weapons:
- Pistol
- Submachine Gun
- Rifle
- Shotgun

### Headshot Damage Multiplier
When shooting a zombie in the head, the damage dealt by the weapon per shot will be doubled.

### Weapon Upgrades
You can access a machine that will allow you to upgrade your current weapon in exchange for $3500. This upgrade will increase the damage and firing speed of your weapon by 50%, which will be important in higher rounds.

### Zombies
Zombies will be generated automatically at different points in the Hangar. Based on the round in which the game is, they will have different attributes.

### Vending Machines
You can use vending machines found in the Hangar, which offer special drinks that will give you advantages in the game, such as increased life and firing speed. To obtain these drinks, you must redeem a certain amount of money depending on the machine.

### Money Accumulation
Each zombie elimination will give you $150. This money can be accumulated and used to buy weapons through the mystery box, access special drinks, or upgrade a weapon.

### Progressive Difficulty
The game consists of rounds. As the player advances in the rounds, the quantity and resistance of the zombies will increase, thus causing greater difficulty in surviving.
